# Salesforce Generic Mapping

Provides tools to make it easier for modules to create mapping interfaces and
store the created maps for their custom data objects.

In the future, the goal is to merge `salesforce_mapping` and `salesforce_genmap`
into one module `salesforce_map` that would provide extentions for the `webform`
and `entity` modules.


## Configuration

Config page: admin/config/salesforce/salesforce-generic

@TODO: There appear to be no configuration options


## How to map a custom data object

## Support to expand modules

The `salesforce_genmap` module will allow you to expand an existing module for the
purpose of adding mapping support into those modules.  For example, the
`webform` module does not come with support for mapping its submissions so we
have provided it through the extended modules system.  Using the same system,
the `salesforce_mapping` module has been modified to streamline its interface
for the `springboard` workflow.

To expand a module, add an include file to the `includes/modules` directory that
has the filename structure of `my_module.inc`.  For example, if the module you
wished to expand was `views_bulk_operation` you would name the file
`views_bulk_operation.inc`.  The include file will only be loaded if the
original module is enabled.  The list of expanded modules is cached, so clear
the cache if the include file is not loading properly.

## Patches

These patches to the `salesforce` module are required in order for the
`salesforce_mapping` extension of the `salesforce_genmap` module to work
correctly.

_All patches are automatically applied when a `springboard` instance is built
using [Springboard Build](https://github.com/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build)._

**Add caching to Salesforce information requests:**
  * http://drupal.org/files/1867156-salesforce_cache_objects_0.patch

Information from Salesforce is frequently requested on forms and that
information is currently not stored in order to prevent requests from occurring
again.  The goal is to minimize calls during rapid-succession request
situations.


**Misc bug fixes:**
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-bug_fixes-v1/0001-code-sniffer-adhearance.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-bug_fixes-v1/0002-Fix-instances-of-ocassional-PHP-notices.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-bug_fixes-v1/0003-Fix-bug-where-mapping-name-length-was-not-being-vali.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-bug_fixes-v1/0004-Fix-issue-if-key-is-set-to-first-row.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-bug_fixes-v1/0005-Fix-issue-where-key-form-error-would-target-first-ro.patch

Most of these are minor, however, patch 0004 could prevent validation when it
was necessary.


**Fix ajax validation issue:**
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-fix_ajax_validation-v3/0001-Extract-logic-for-finding-default-form-field-value-i.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-fix_ajax_validation-v3/0002-Fix-issue-with-form-validation-caused-by-ajax-calls.patch

This is considered a critical issue because the issue prevented the ability to
build tests on the form. The issue was caused by having each ajax request
validate the entire form, which would cause simpletest to abort.


**Salesforce Mapping form enhancements:**
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-enhancements-v1/0001-Change-key-requirement-from-externalId-to-idLookup.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-enhancements-v1/0002-Make-mapping-table-easier-to-alter.patch
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-enhancements-v1/0003-Make-select-options-more-descriptive.patch

These are not strictly considered bugs, however, 0001 is considered required
because the usage of `externalId` is too restrictive, and 0002 allows an easier
ability to modify the form through the use of hook_alters.


**Add simpletests to Salesforce Mapping:**
  * https://raw.github.com/wiki/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build/patches/salesforce-tests-v3/0001-Add-tests-for-entity-mapping.patch

This is considered critical in order to provide a streamlined development
environment.
