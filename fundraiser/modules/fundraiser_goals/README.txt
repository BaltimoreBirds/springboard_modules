-- SUMMARY --

This module lets you associate goals (total dollar amount donated, number of submissions, etc) to donation forms and webforms. It tracks goal progress and provides blocks to display progress towards this goal. It also supports creating custom goal blocks for use when the canned block is a poor fit.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

* Fundraiser module.

-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- USAGE --

Goal settings can be managed for individual forms on the form node edit page. These settings control the display in the goal block provided by the module. Custom goal blocks can be added from the block administration page.
