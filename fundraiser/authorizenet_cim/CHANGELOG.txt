    * fundraiser.module (fundraiser_update_node): added code to prevent arbitrary node properties from being overwritten
      when node_save() is invoked and the property is unset(). This is in response to a bug wherein confirmation page format
      reverts to "filtered HTML" if the node form is edited.
