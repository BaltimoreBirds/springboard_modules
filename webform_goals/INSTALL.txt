In addition to enabling the Webform Goals module you need to do
a few more things to get the module working locally and
on remote sites.

--- Serving goal data ---
To display goal data on your local site, or on 3rd party websites via the external loader script,
you will need to copy webform_goals.jsonp.php to the webform_goals subdirectory in your files folder.

To minimize load on your server, this file parses goal widget files 
and serves the contents via jsonp without bootstrapping Drupal.

You may also need to modify .htaccess in the files folder to permit php to run in files subfolders.

--- Loading goal data locally ---
To display locally you will need to edit the following file:

scripts/webform_goals.drupal_loader.js 

Modify the following line:

url = 'http://DOMAIN/PATH/TO/files/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php'

Replace DOMAIN with your site domain and PATH/TO with the file path to the files folder.
Example: http://example.com/sites/default/files/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php

--- Loading goal data on an external website ---
To display goal data from your site on other websites you will need to first edit
scripts/webform_goals.loader.js 

Modify the following line:

url = 'http://DOMAIN/PATH/TO/files/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php'

Replace DOMAIN with your site domain and PATH/TO with the file path to the files folder.
Example: http://example.com/sites/default/files/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php
