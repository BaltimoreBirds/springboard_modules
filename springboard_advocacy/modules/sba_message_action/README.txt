SBA Message Action is a webform-enabled and webform-user-enabled node type for "contact your congressperson"
type messages, which can also include non-legislator custom targets.

The message action node consists of title, image, call-to-action and body fields,
the body being an extended description of the action. There are also two associated taxonomies,
one to match the expected subject fields on congressional contact forms, and another to
categorize the actions according to the client's preferred categories.

After creating a new Message Action node, administrators are redirected to the messages tab,
where they are prompted to create a message to attach to the message webform node.
Targets are added during this message creation process. Multiple messages with multiple targets
can be attached to a single Message Action webform node.

The messages are Entity API entities attached via entity references.
