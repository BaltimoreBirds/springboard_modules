Springboard Target creates and manages custom targets for use in Springboard Actions.

The targets are saved remotely on the Springboard Advocacy API server.

A default view is provided for an administrative list of targets.

Create and Edit forms are provided by the files in "includes" and the
functions that call the API server are located there as well.

This module is a dependency of SBA Message Action and SBA Message modules.
