-- SUMMARY --

The Gateway Manager module adds support for multiple payment gateways to Ubercart's built in
payment gateway system. In a standard Ubarcart install you may only have one instance of a gateway.

This is usually sufficient for online payment processing for a single site, however this can lead to
issues when more than one organization or accounting group needs to use the same type of payment
processing.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

* Fundraiser module
