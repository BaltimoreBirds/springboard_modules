    * salesforce_management.class.inc (login function): Fixed a bug where IF you
    can't connect to Salesforce with your credentials, it gives a WSOD and you 
    have to remove the variables manually to retry. We have removed the offending
    method call (which is just trying to send info to watchdog), as the existing
    exception provided is adequate. Now, if the login credentials OR setup fail,
    it won't kill portions of the site. Credit goes to Ben for helping me track it down.

    * salesforce_management_api.module (salesforce_management_api_get_campaigns) - $cid was undefined in cache_set(), which caused a record to be added to the cache table with a blank cid column. This essentially invalidates the use of cache here, since the cache_get() call uses the string literal 'salesforce_campaigns' for cid.

    * salesforce_management_api.module (drush integration) - removed legacy Drush integration.
