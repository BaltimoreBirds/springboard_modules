    * salesforce_management.class.inc (login function): Fixed a bug where IF you
    can't connect to Salesforce with your credentials, it gives a WSOD and you 
    have to remove the variables manually to retry. We have removed the offending
    method call (which is just trying to send info to watchdog), as the existing
    exception provided is adequate. Now, if the login credentials OR setup fail,
    it won't kill portions of the site. Credit goes to Ben for helping me track it down.

    * salesforce_management_api.module (drush integration) - removed legacy Drush integration.
