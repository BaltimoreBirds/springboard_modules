    * salesforce_management_api.module (salesforce_management_api_get_campaigns) - $cid was undefined in cache_set(), which caused a record to be added to the cache table with a blank cid column. This essentially invalidates the use of cache here, since the cache_get() call uses the string literal 'salesforce_campaigns' for cid.

    * salesforce_management_api.module (drush integration) - removed legacy Drush integration.
