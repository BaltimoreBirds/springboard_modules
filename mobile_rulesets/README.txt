Installation
============

Mobile Rulesets requires the Mobile Detect PHP library to function. Before enabling this module you will need to install this library.

* download a copy of Mobile Detect: https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/tags
* unpack a copy in sites/all/libraries
* You should now have the following file: sites/all/libraries/Mobile_Detect/Mobile_Detect.php

Once this is done enable Mobile Rulesets from the module administration screen or via drush:

drush en mobile_rulesets
